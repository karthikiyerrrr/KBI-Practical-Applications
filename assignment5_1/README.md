## Assignment 5.1 Report
I analyzed the Coffee House coupon data. 

Based on the first portion of my analysis, people are most likely to use the coupon on sunny mornings, and least likely on non-sunny afternoons.

Based on the second portion of my analysis, younger people are more likely to use the coupon, however it seems having/not having a partner does not play a significant role.
